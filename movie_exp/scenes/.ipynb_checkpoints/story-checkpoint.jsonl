{"text_a": "Mari was a very beautiful woman, with a very kind heart and a very strong will. She loved her country and she wanted the world to know the beauty of the country, Bond said. \"That she was in the jungle, that she'd been wounded in a war, that I could help her recover, I couldn't believe it. She had never been so badly wounded, so badly injured.\"\nShe wanted to recover, and she asked Bond to help her. He said no.", "text_b": "The door is open, and there is a path beyond, Bond told Mari. \"You can make a new life. The path can only lead to you. It's a difficult path, but a great path.\nYou must find a way. You will not succeed without a great will. A great mind.\"\n\"I believe in you, Mr. Bond.\"\nHe said yes, but that was the last time he would ever speak with her.\nThe next day, Bond was in a room, watching the news, and then he heard the call to a doctor. He went over to the door and saw Mari. Her face was pale. She asked him, \"What are you doing here?\"\n\"Well, I was wondering if you'd like to meet my friend, Agent 007. He's been asking me all about you lately, and I was just wondering if I could see you for a bit.", "label": 1}
{"text_a": "This is what the man said to the woman. I'm James Bond, and I know how to get to Mari and you, and there is a doorway.\"\n\"How did he know this?\" Mari asked.\nJames didn't tell Mari. He didn't have to.\nHe simply said \"I will tell you how I did it.\" He did not explain how, but instead simply stated that if Mari could figure it out on her own, he could do it, too.", "text_b": "We walked through the doors and went into a hallway with four sets of double doors leading to four sets, and each set was on its own floor, but all four sets had doors at the end that led to a door that opened into the main corridor, and that is what led to the stairs. The main corridor had several sets of doors that opened on four different floors. On the second floor there was a set of double-doors that led into a set that looked like a large kitchen, and a set on the third floor looked like the dining room, and then there was the set on top of the first floor that looked very much like a bedroom.\nThe man then walked down the main hallway and into the living room.\nMari: \"You are James Bond. Do you know anything about Majuro?\"\nJames did not answer Mari, but just walked toward the kitchen and stopped and stood at the table and pointed at a cup.\n\"What's that?", "label": 5}

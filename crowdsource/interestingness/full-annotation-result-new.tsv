In the summer of 1889, the small town of Washoe was the perfect place to raise a family. George W., a boy of fourteen, and Penny, a girl of sixteen, moved in, and the Wilson's began to plan a wonderful life together. Penny and George W.'s lives changed forever in June 1890.

When Nanette was a child, her father and stepmother were killed in a horrific car accident. They were buried in a shallow grave and she was left to raise her brother and sister. One day, a new neighbor named Mark Prentchard showed up at her home and introduced himself to Nanette. Mark offered to buy Nanette's dog and take her on a walk to find a dead body. Nanette was left on her own and she walked for days. She found her father's body, buried deep inside a small hollow in the forest. A few days after that, she found a dead squirrel, too.	scratchplot	13	4				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/32262352/0001ec48d0--622997e64fce190ebdaa06e5	59f81c55-fb95-4932-995a-46361164af18	0001ec48d0--622997e64fce190ebdaa06e5	4afdadf50331102537133144224a6d32	APPROVED	2022-03-10T06:17:10.896

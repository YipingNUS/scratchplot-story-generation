I just don't understand the characters. The plot of the movie is a great movie. But, how did it get that way? What happens in the movie, happens for a reason. It has a good story. If the movie makes no sense to me, it is because the director failed to put me into the movie for a second. When the story gets old, the characters lose their meaning."	gpt2	27

A plot summary with information about each plot (2:15) Plot summaries can be useful to summarize the plot of a novel and the plot summary can be written by hand or typed, or even done online. I found it to be very helpful to create my own plot summary and review it in the same manner, so I thought I'd share it here. Note: I used the Google Drive service for the plot summaries. It saves the plot into an easily digestible format that you can copy and paste into Excel and Open Office and Google Docs and anything else. The Plot Summary is a summary of the plot. It is not a summary for plot development. A plot synopsis should have two parts.	gpt2	45

Plot summary is a summary of the main action. It is intended to give an idea of the general plot and the main characters, their situation and their objectives. It gives the reader a general impression of what is about to happen in the book. Plot summaries are important because it will help the reader know where the story is headed, and what it means. I always recommend the reader to read a plot synopsis before actually reading the story because this is a crucial step. I recommend the plot summary for two reasons: It gives you a feel for the direction the story will be taking, and the story can be influenced by the plot summaries.	gpt2	41

The plot summary tells the reader what the story is about. Plot summaries are very long and sometimes the authors need to explain some things and show the readers something. I use a simple one here: The plot summaries of most of the books I read are in the order of their publication date (as seen above). The authors do not like the readers to have to remember this order, so they just list the events in a very long way. I have seen plots summary in the form of a list in the back of a book, but that has problems: the reader has to find the book. A plot summary in a book will be much more readable and more likely to get across the events.	gpt2	0

Here is a plot synopsis of the data I have collected over the past 4 months. As you can see the data has shown significant variations in the past. These can be explained by a number of factors such as: weather (temperature, humidity, wind), wind direction (from west, east, north, south), time of day (morning, afternoon, evening), and the amount of sunlight (sunlight is not constant throughout the day, but it changes gradually, so some areas receive more light, others receive less light, depending on the season). The variation in temperature is especially noticeable during the day because it's more difficult to determine the relative humidity.	gpt2	16

In this study, we show that the presence of a small sample of high-frequency noise can increase the amount of variance observed in the distribution of a random variable and that it can cause a type of'snowballing' of the data. The summary sentence was added after I was asked to add it. It's a nice little piece of syntactic work. Preliminary tests indicated that the summary worked. However, once I started to implement it, my code did not run well. It worked when I ran it on a test machine with a fast processor, but I had to wait a minute before the test ran, so I decided that it was not a viable option.	gpt2	25

The Enterprise encounters a pair of Klingon ships in the Gamma Quadrant. The Klingons are seeking to use a device to reverse the aging process, but they need to acquire the Romulan vessel to beam it aboard. While the Enterprise's sensors scan the area for the Romulus-class starship, the Klingons use a cloaking device. They then beam the Romuli ship and its crew off course. The Enterprise is able to track the Klingon ships using the Romulo-type 2 deflector shields, but it is unable to penetrate the Romulas' shields. The Romulans are able to evade the Enterprise, but the Enterprise is not able to get close enough to beam up the Romulinian crew.	gpt2	36

Plot summaries are one of the most important aspects of your narrative. They will help the reader understand the context of the events of the novel. As a storyteller, you must be aware of how important plot summaries can be. Without them, you risk the reader skipping over what matters and diving right into the action. 1. Plot summaries should be clear and descriptive. A plot summary should be the first thing the reader sees. Don't try to make it sound like a press release. Try to keep your sentences short.	gpt2	43

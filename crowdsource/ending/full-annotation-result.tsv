Joe and Polly are on board ship when they are summoned for a meeting of a company with a mission of world wide expansion. They are asked to help to establish a new production site in the south-west of Australia. This project is a joint venture between a company in the US and the Australian company. The company has chosen Polly as the production manager and Joe as the project manager and they are to be joined by a young Australian engineer.	A young family of four and their young son are returning from their holiday in the west. The ship is running late but Joe and Polly are not worried, as they are not going to be late at all. After being dropped off at the last port of call, the family get a ride from an unfamiliar taxi and begin their journey back to Brisbane.	Polly and Joe find themselves faced with a complex problem that is not easily solved by traditional methods. As they begin to investigate and solve the problem they will face a number of challenges that they have never encountered before.	They arrived home. The journey was uneventful. And when they got home, they sat on the sofa. Joe and the children sat there for hours and then went to bed.

Mary is eager to see her, and Bob wants her to have a good time. Mary knows the McKeans are a nice, upstanding family, but she is surprised by their attitude toward the couple who have lived here for many years.	They had a great time. They played their favorite songs and ate ice cream. They had lots of laughs and talked about their lives and their love for each other.

After an accident at work John goes missing and Maggie, who is a young artist, becomes obsessed with finding him. While John's friends attempt to help Maggie, John becomes increasingly worried about her. As John gets more and more distant, Maggie's art gets more advanced. Maggie has begun to draw pictures that are more and less like pictures.	They found an old car buried beneath the sand, abandoned by a young man, and he had taken Maggie's hand and was driving her away. He was driving into the sea, and they could not see him from the beach.	She doesn't know it yet, but she's going to find John. She has to.	nsp	rank	43	1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/30578585/0001d29799--61c54653b756df533ecc5a57	0001d29799--61c53dfb8a7e2d04d1b13489	0001d29799--61c54653b756df533ecc5a57	f0d29388e43fb51bf4f303eb728f7853	APPROVED	2021-12-24T04:02:27.937

The first year of Bella C's life, John Smith lived with his mother in the tiny town of North Pole, Alaska. Bella's parents, a widowed couple, had separated a few years earlier, and it seemed as if the relationship was destined for divorce.

In 1816, John Smith, an ordinary man who is not much older than Bella C, discovers his destiny in a dream of an old friend, and after being told he will never be anything more than an ordinary townsperson, his heart and body are transformed into a hero and a villain respectively. John Smith is a very good guy who goes from being a normal townspouse to being a hero in the span of one night.	When Bella moved into her new house, she was excited and anxious for a fresh start. But when her mother moved into a smaller apartment nearby, her hope for a new start was dashed.	In the morning, John woke up in the bed of his old friend.

On their very first evening, their new housemates made an unannounced visit to the front door, where they found John's former housemate, a young woman, asleep on the sofa. The housemates were surprised by the presence of another housemate on the living room couch. That housemate had been the subject of several earlier incidents.	John and Cheryl had decided that they'd get a divorce. They'd never been married, and they'd always been in the midst of an argument that had escalated to violence. John had left the house, locked the door behind him, and walked into the woods. Cheryl had followed him, but after a brief conversation with her father and a call to an ex-boyfriend from his stepmother, she had walked out to the car.	A new kind of loneliness has fallen over us, the kind that is a thousand years old.

Maevis has been in the past when Michael had needed someone to go with. But that wasn't the worst of it because Maevis also doesn't have a boyfriend.	The two of them get a job but they are assigned to a different part of the town.	Michael and Maeve became best friends, and the rest of their lives were filled with friendship and love.	rank	ppl	37	2				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/30578585/0001d29799--61c54708b756df533ecc5e58	0001d29799--61c53dfb8a7e2d04d1b13451	0001d29799--61c54708b756df533ecc5e58	fcde1ebc05bc9a70de0a9582b327efa1	APPROVED	2021-12-24T04:05:28.025

Javale McGee has just moved into his new house with his long-time girlfriend Polly and his new dog, Razz, who has a penchant for stealing things. He notices that the house was built before he moved in and, as an act of defiance, he has built a house of his own. As he is finishing up the basement, he notices a mysterious man in a suit walking along the shore.	It was a bright, beautiful day in North, Oregon. Everyone was doing their best to relax on their vacation in the summer of 1984. The children were happy and laughing and giggling as the sun was setting. Then, all of a sudden, it began to rain. They were all soaked, but Polly was the first to make a break for the house. She took the two of them in her arms and tried to find her wet shoes, but to no avail.

Javale McGee has just moved into his new house with his long-time girlfriend Polly and his new dog, Razz, who has a penchant for stealing things. He notices that the house was built before he moved in and, as an act of defiance, he has built a house of his own. As he is finishing up the basement, he notices a mysterious man in a suit walking along the shore.	It was a bright, beautiful day in North, Oregon. Everyone was doing their best to relax on their vacation in the summer of 1984. The children were happy and laughing and giggling as the sun was setting. Then, all of a sudden, it began to rain. They were all soaked, but Polly was the first to make a break for the house. She took the two of them in her arms and tried to find her wet shoes, but to no avail.

In a world without government or laws, the law of gravity was suspended in an enormous underground space called the Underground Bunker. There, the four people, who were called Eileen, William John, David and George, lived in relative seclusion as members of the 'Cannons' resistance movement, against the rule of a tyrannical and oppressive government.	In 2054, William John, a successful businessman in Belfast, has decided to leave his life of luxury to spend the rest of his days as a wanderer. Eileen, the mother of his two children, is still trying to adjust to life in the modern world and has become convinced that the only reason she is getting old is because of her own sins.	The Underground Bunker, a vast subterranean complex, was built to house the underground government, but in the time of the book, this underground government had collapsed. Now, the Underground bunker is under attack from the forces of freedom.	It is a tale of despair and survival, of a lonely man who becomes something more than the sum of his regrets.	rank	random	41	2				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/30578585/0001d29799--61c5495254fd1476dfb15014	0001d29799--61c53dfb8a7e2d04d1b134b9	0001d29799--61c5495254fd1476dfb15014	fcde1ebc05bc9a70de0a9582b327efa1	APPROVED	2021-12-24T04:15:14.118

That night, they decided to find out. They went to the local park and sat next to a bench that had an empty bench and some chairs, and waited for the sun to set. Dorothy sat in the corner and closed her eyes.	On the night of June 5th, 1941 Jose and his sister Dorothy were on the way to Lisbon to spend a few days with the family in the house of their friend, João de Jesus Ferreira. After a few hours of sleeping, José suddenly woke up in the middle of the night with a start. He was unable to stand and started crawling towards his mother and sister. His sister, Dorothy, tried to pull him back down to the floor.	When the sun sets, the light of the full moon begins to illuminate the entire landscape. The sun and moon are so bright that the shadows of all the trees in the park have a golden hue.	After a few more moments of confusion, the two adults found themselves on the floor, both motionless. Jose's body was still motionless and he could not move.	rank	ppl	8	1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/30578585/0001d29799--61c549a2fcd8cc1d864f67a8	0001d29799--61c53dfb8a7e2d04d1b13434	0001d29799--61c549a2fcd8cc1d864f67a8	f8355b9c44701b88228ceb93c3935964	APPROVED	2021-12-24T04:16:34.771
A small child in North who has an imaginary friend that she plays with, Polly, begins to tell her parents about her new friend's past. Polly's father and her mother become worried about her imaginary friend, and decide to call the police to have Polly take her to a therapist. They call the therapist to help them and Polly becomes upset that her imaginary friends have been taken away from her.	It was a bright, beautiful day in North, Oregon. Everyone was doing their best to relax on their vacation in the summer of 1984. The children were happy and laughing and giggling as the sun was setting. Then, all of a sudden, it began to rain. They were all soaked, but Polly was the first to make a break for the house. She took the two of them in her arms and tried to find her wet shoes, but to no avail.	In the end, Polly is reunited with her friend and the therapist.	They walked across the street to a gas station for a few minutes before stopping by a convenience store for some soda. The girl said that she'd take them home. Polly thought that was weird, but didn't say anything.	ppl	rank	39	1				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/30578585/0001d29799--61c549a562fc8844007e7ccc	0001d29799--61c53dfb8a7e2d04d1b13453	0001d29799--61c549a562fc8844007e7ccc	f30bffa774ccd7f850af8b1bb2ee202e	APPROVED	2021-12-24T04:16:37.926

A young family of four and their young son are returning from their holiday in the west. The ship is running late but Joe and Polly are not worried, as they are not going to be late at all. After being dropped off at the last port of call, the family get a ride from an unfamiliar taxi and begin their journey back to Brisbane.	In late December, Polly's mother is taken ill. Her husband, Joe Smith, heads up the ship on a mission to find a cure and, when he doesn't return, the Captain makes a call to Polly. On the phone, Polly tells him that the ship has had a problem with its rudder since the morning and that there was no sign of Joe, that she was only able to reach him through his watch, which had been locked in his cabin.	They arrived home. The journey was uneventful. And when they got home, they sat on the sofa. Joe and the children sat there for hours and then went to bed.

The monster Praveena is a little girl living in the forest of Kerala in India. Praveenne and her family were attacked by a monster, who was an exact copy of her. The family's only hope is to bring her back to life. The monster had no memory of its past life, only of Praveene and her. She is now in the hospital. She has a strong bond with her pet cat, who is a doll. The cat's name is Durga.	Durga is a monster with a soul and Praveena is a girl with a heart and a good heart. But when a monster takes the shape of a girl, the monster is a real girl with human qualities and the girl a fake human, who looks just like a monster, but is actually a human with human soul.	Durga has been taken away from Praveen and her mother. Durga is the only hope the family has of returning her to her original body.

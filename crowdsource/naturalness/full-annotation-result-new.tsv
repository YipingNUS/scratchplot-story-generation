In 1842, the world was in the midst of a dark age, but then a man called Jose Vasconcelos, an ex-miner from Spain, arrived on a ship from Lisbon. He'd been given a mysterious gift by an evil witch, and the witch had been watching him, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. The perfect moment came when Vasconcellos returned home from a dangerous expedition in the jungles of Central America, and fell ill with malaria. He was a good man, and he did the best he could for his family. He loved them very much. He was a fine man, but he had no hope.	scratchplot	18	5				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/32262380/0001ec48ec--622965415af44b5d7e54c277	dcca48ed-f125-437d-bd77-8658819775aa	0001ec48ec--622965415af44b5d7e54c277	f43c8859100f0c1106e859ba74188e6e	APPROVED	2022-03-10T02:41:05.444

In 1842, the world was in the midst of a dark age, but then a man called Jose Vasconcelos, an ex-miner from Spain, arrived on a ship from Lisbon. He'd been given a mysterious gift by an evil witch, and the witch had been watching him, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. The perfect moment came when Vasconcellos returned home from a dangerous expedition in the jungles of Central America, and fell ill with malaria.

Sheltering in a cabin outside South Sudan, Mason Davis, the son of a warlord, and his friend Zelena, an orphan, begin their relationship when she shows interest in his father's prized possession. He begins to doubt his own innocence and their romance begins to blossom. It is an unexpected romance—even for Mason Davis—but one they share. Their love is bound by fate—the fate of the universe. But fate also changes that destiny. It changes Mason's. The universe is on the brink of change. The universe is changing.

The first year of Bella C's life, John Smith lived with his mother in the tiny town of North Pole, Alaska. Bella's parents, a widowed couple, had separated a few years earlier, and it seemed as if the relationship was destined for divorce.

When Bella moved into her new house, she was excited and anxious for a fresh start. But when her mother moved into a smaller apartment nearby, her hope for a new start was dashed.	scratchplot	44	4				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/32262380/0001ec48ec--62297422655dc258c5bf7a1a	3f924c37-482a-4abd-b566-a11058c046f9	0001ec48ec--62297422655dc258c5bf7a1a	4f0f1c7b516d81490c4ab639c6aaa720	APPROVED	2022-03-10T03:44:34.346

Zemal was a small child in a small village in the middle of the forest. He used to live alone in the forest, which was a place where all animals lived. Every day, Zemel used to go out into the forest to find some insects. One day, he came across a strange looking dog, Nessie. Nessie looked exactly like a dog, and she was always nice and obedient. The boy started to play with Nessie and she would obey him. Zemal had never seen a dog like that before. He didn't know anything about the animals, so Nessie began to teach him how to talk to them.	scratchplot	26	5				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/32262380/0001ec48ec--622976d74a82ca09cd194b25	23046d79-dfd7-4838-baf3-d9a132b6efa4	0001ec48ec--622976d74a82ca09cd194b25	4fcec748108d9b79c2b0e8ddf3071d93	APPROVED	2022-03-10T03:56:07.248

After they eat, Jose tells her it was a bad idea and asks her to move out of the house.	scratchplot	7	1				0001d2371f--61c4097af7e0c75a030449f8	0001d2371f--61c40dea1c3a7842a567907f	ea4688c3e164e391a46f15566b0020de	2021-12-23T05:49:30.996

On February 11, 2016, a small asteroid will pass closest to Earth. The asteroid is not expected to pose a threat to our planet. Asteroid: 2012 DA14 will approach Earth at a distance of 0.8-1.1 million kilometers, while its orbit is well known. The event is expected to occur on February 11 at 17:42 UTC, and the asteroid will approach with a velocity of 1,500 meters per second. The asteroid's close approach is due to its close approach to the Sun, which will cause it to glow for about two hours. At the same time, Earth's orbit will change and the Sun will begin to brighten.	gpt2	12	5				0001d2371f--61c4097af7e0c75a03044a5d	0001d2371f--61c40fb85411d05ee07e03e3	ff71944a983644b91bbb007a2457ec3f	2021-12-23T05:57:12.252

Here is a plot synopsis of the data I have collected over the past 4 months. As you can see the data has shown significant variations in the past. These can be explained by a number of factors such as: weather (temperature, humidity, wind), wind direction (from west, east, north, south), time of day (morning, afternoon, evening), and the amount of sunlight (sunlight is not constant throughout the day, but it changes gradually, so some areas receive more light, others receive less light, depending on the season). The variation in temperature is especially noticeable during the day because it's more difficult to determine the relative humidity.	gpt2	16	5				0001d2371f--61c4097af7e0c75a03044a51	0001d2371f--61c410e678760350ef1bdd69	ff71944a983644b91bbb007a2457ec3f	2021-12-23T06:02:14.492
A plot summary with information about each plot (2:15) Plot summaries can be useful to summarize the plot of a novel and the plot summary can be written by hand or typed, or even done online. I found it to be very helpful to create my own plot summary and review it in the same manner, so I thought I'd share it here. Note: I used the Google Drive service for the plot summaries. It saves the plot into an easily digestible format that you can copy and paste into Excel and Open Office and Google Docs and anything else. The Plot Summary is a summary of the plot. It is not a summary for plot development. A plot synopsis should have two parts.	gpt2	45	3				0001d2371f--61c4097af7e0c75a030449c7	0001d2371f--61c4111ff327c2360f5d77cd	ff71944a983644b91bbb007a2457ec3f	2021-12-23T06:03:11.645

Here is a plot synopsis of the data I have collected over the past 4 months. As you can see the data has shown significant variations in the past. These can be explained by a number of factors such as: weather (temperature, humidity, wind), wind direction (from west, east, north, south), time of day (morning, afternoon, evening), and the amount of sunlight (sunlight is not constant throughout the day, but it changes gradually, so some areas receive more light, others receive less light, depending on the season). The variation in temperature is especially noticeable during the day because it's more difficult to determine the relative humidity.	gpt2	16	1				0001d2371f--61c4097af7e0c75a03044a51	0001d2371f--61c413f7af898e1caeb3b363	e32afb211d52d994348979c00ae1864b	2021-12-23T06:15:19.960

Here is a plot synopsis of the data I have collected over the past 4 months. As you can see the data has shown significant variations in the past. These can be explained by a number of factors such as: weather (temperature, humidity, wind), wind direction (from west, east, north, south), time of day (morning, afternoon, evening), and the amount of sunlight (sunlight is not constant throughout the day, but it changes gradually, so some areas receive more light, others receive less light, depending on the season). The variation in temperature is especially noticeable during the day because it's more difficult to determine the relative humidity.	gpt2	16	5				0001d2371f--61c4097af7e0c75a03044a51	0001d2371f--61c419fecd524d5be65d7959	ff7901630f277947978c0b0e9ab08e8c	2021-12-23T06:41:02.908
A plot summary with information about each plot (2:15) Plot summaries can be useful to summarize the plot of a novel and the plot summary can be written by hand or typed, or even done online. I found it to be very helpful to create my own plot summary and review it in the same manner, so I thought I'd share it here. Note: I used the Google Drive service for the plot summaries. It saves the plot into an easily digestible format that you can copy and paste into Excel and Open Office and Google Docs and anything else. The Plot Summary is a summary of the plot. It is not a summary for plot development. A plot synopsis should have two parts.	gpt2	45	1				0001d2371f--61c4097af7e0c75a030449c7	0001d2371f--61c41a0378760350ef1c377a	ebf041c7986e54c901d214057e6e1ac0	2021-12-23T06:41:07.782

The plot summary tells the reader what the story is about. Plot summaries are very long and sometimes the authors need to explain some things and show the readers something. I use a simple one here: The plot summaries of most of the books I read are in the order of their publication date (as seen above). The authors do not like the readers to have to remember this order, so they just list the events in a very long way. I have seen plots summary in the form of a list in the back of a book, but that has problems: the reader has to find the book. A plot summary in a book will be much more readable and more likely to get across the events.	gpt2	0	3				0001d2371f--61c4097af7e0c75a03044a4f	0001d2371f--61c41b47a2ac1301fae185fd	ff7901630f277947978c0b0e9ab08e8c	2021-12-23T06:46:31.922

That night, they decided to find out. They went to the local park and sat next to a bench that had an empty bench and some chairs, and waited for the sun to set. Dorothy sat in the corner and closed her eyes. When the sun sets, the light of the full moon begins to illuminate the entire landscape. The sun and moon are so bright that the shadows of all the trees in the park have a golden hue.	scratchplot	8	5				0001d2371f--61c4097af7e0c75a03044a44	0001d2371f--61c41b6437f4ac13d1a5a40e	ff7901630f277947978c0b0e9ab08e8c	2021-12-23T06:47:00.950

In this study, we show that the presence of a small sample of high-frequency noise can increase the amount of variance observed in the distribution of a random variable and that it can cause a type of'snowballing' of the data.

Plot summary is a summary of the main action. It is intended to give an idea of the general plot and the main characters, their situation and their objectives. It gives the reader a general impression of what is about to happen in the book. Plot summaries are important because it will help the reader know where the story is headed, and what it means. I always recommend the reader to read a plot synopsis before actually reading the story because this is a crucial step. I recommend the plot summary for two reasons: It gives you a feel for the direction the story will be taking, and the story can be influenced by the plot summaries.	gpt2	41	5				0001d2371f--61c4097af7e0c75a030449d8	0001d2371f--61c41ead691c5427b2d7a460	ed8131a3a7698215237b1d542828eb22	2021-12-23T07:01:01.312

After John had walked down the driveway, he came up behind Cheryl in her driveway and punched her in the face with both fists.	scratchplot	2	1				0001d2371f--61c4097af7e0c75a030449fb	0001d2371f--61c41f778619c330597c8881	e7395b8c005c0f34803b0925ad7ae924	2021-12-23T07:04:23.533

It was a bright, beautiful day in North, Oregon. Everyone was doing their best to relax on their vacation in the summer of 1984. The children were happy and laughing and giggling as the sun was setting. Then, all of a sudden, it began to rain. They were all soaked, but Polly was the first to make a break for the house. She took the two of them in her arms and tried to find her wet shoes, but to no avail. They walked across the street to a gas station for a few minutes before stopping by a convenience store for some soda. The girl said that she'd take them home. Polly thought that was weird, but didn't say anything.	scratchplot	39	1				0001d2371f--61c4097af7e0c75a03044a63	0001d2371f--61c41f939e9ad906ecf11060	f4f47723aa23fbeda88d3c01862be37a	2021-12-23T07:04:51.367

This is a plot of the distribution of a variable for a small population, with each variable denoting a set of observations. The variables are grouped in equal proportions, with the number of observations at each level indicating the degree to which each variable contributes to the distribution. Note that a variable has a different significance level depending on whether the population is very large or very small. The variable names are as follows: 1 = number of people, 2 = number living in the town, 3 = number alive in the year, 4 = percentage of people who are in the country (i.e. alive) 5 = the number alive of each sex. 6 = number who are married, 7 = number unmarried, 8 = age of the youngest child.	gpt2	7	5				0001d2371f--61c4097af7e0c75a03044a4b	0001d2371f--61c41fb3333f4371ec2ff30b	f6d02aac7d314e37dbbbc54b0e45d210	2021-12-23T07:05:23.776

There, the four people, who were called Eileen, William John, David and George, lived in relative seclusion as members of the 'Cannons' resistance movement, against the rule of a tyrannical and oppressive government. The Underground Bunker, a vast subterranean complex, was built to house the underground government, but in the time of the book, this underground government had collapsed.

Karl and Catherine were born into the noble family of Albrecht von Carstein. They were both intelligent and capable, and enjoyed the social status of their families. However, when their father, the future Kaiser, died in battle in 1742, it fell to Catherine to raise her two children and to bear the burden of their father's will. She and Karl had been educated at the university of Jena and at the court of the Habsburgs. After the death of their paternal grandfather, the Albrechts were reduced to poverty and forced to live in the shadow of the family estate, which was administered by the Hapsburgs.	scratchplot	35	5				0001d2371f--61c4097af7e0c75a030449e3	0001d2371f--61c42052b5c5cf70e16211a3	ed888b9309df6d0e70b800e331935b67	2021-12-23T07:08:02.851

George Jones and his wife Jane decided to start a business, called The Key. They decided to give their business to their sons, David and John. In doing so, the boys, who were in high school, were the ones that started the company and George Jones was the chief financial officer.

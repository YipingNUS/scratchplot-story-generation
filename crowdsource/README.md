## Human Evaluation Dataset for the Manuscript "Plot Writing From Pre-Trained Language Models"

- Each folder contains the human evaluation results for each aspect
- The fine-grained evaluation all use the data in the root folder
- The ending evaluation use the data in the ``/ending` folder since its format is different
- The `general.tsv` data was the input for the human evaluation in the original manuscript.
- We conducted more evaluation because we modified our method and added new baselines. The new data is in `general-new.tsv`.

We'll clean up the source code and publish it along with the final version of the paper.

When Khadijah was about to go to the wedding of John H., John took her to the house of Abraham and had sex with her. He had to take an oath of chastity for Khadiyah to enter the new city called Ur of the Chaldees. Then John brought her to Jerusalem, where she fell in love with Solomon, who was a great prophet. But she was not interested in marrying him. In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And God said, Let there be light; and there was light.	scratchplot	3	3				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/32262391/0001ec48f7--6229685d0dcab8597d7fd1a2	ce770c23-d3e1-4e26-b652-e6087d251e44	0001ec48f7--6229685d0dcab8597d7fd1a2	517f437f0585da695dae1312ec63989e	APPROVED	2022-03-10T02:54:21.726

It all began with the idea that Michael and his friend Maeve need more friends. Michael's grandfather had recently passed away and he needed to find a friend to fill the void. Unfortunately Michael's old friend Maevis is the type who doesn't get along with others and she won't even go with Michael to school. Maevis has been in the past when Michael had needed someone to go with. But that wasn't the worst of it because Maevis also doesn't have a boyfriend. Michael and Maeve became best friends, and the rest of their lives were filled with friendship and love.	scratchplot	37	3				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/32262391/0001ec48f7--622968615b075e1d27d147aa	c795c1fc-18fc-4753-a2b7-4cd377459025	0001ec48f7--622968615b075e1d27d147aa	517f437f0585da695dae1312ec63989e	APPROVED	2022-03-10T02:54:25.512

When Bella moved into her new house, she was excited and anxious for a fresh start.

The city was built centuries ago to contain a god, but after the god was killed by an evil wizard, the city is now a desolate wasteland, waiting for the next god to be summoned. The wizard is still around, and now he has sent a young girl, Sarah, to Ireland to retrieve her dead god's remains. Joe is not happy about the plan.

In the summer of 1889, the small town of Washoe was the perfect place to raise a family. George W., a boy of fourteen, and Penny, a girl of sixteen, moved in, and the Wilson's began to plan a wonderful life together. Penny and George W.'s lives changed forever in June 1890. George had recently turned eighteen and, in accordance with the laws of his state of Idaho, he could legally marry his sweetheart Penny. Penny's family, however, didn't approve. They believed that George should wait to marry until he was at least twenty-five years old.	scratchplot	49	5				https://toloka.yandex.ru/task/32262391/0001ec48f7--62296ad5839fdc6ec42a1da1	811f95be-c4d7-4720-b4a4-f86e20ccdc55	0001ec48f7--62296ad5839fdc6ec42a1da1	68c2eb79292a7e1bee7247ff592b0ec7	APPROVED	2022-03-10T03:04:53.357
